Tickish
==========

Tickish is a very simple, light weight ticket tracker. The definition of simple is that you don't have to register to create a project.
If you some how want to register an account, you can easily use Google, Twitter or any other Oauth provider.

New functionality is added all the time, keep that in mind :)

Visit http://tickish.com to get started today!

Install Notes
-------------

1. Create a project at http://tickish.com
2. Visit the project page, and click on the options link.
3. Copy the API key from the dashboard and paste it into Github's Service Hook panel

The commit message needs to contain the id of the issue you want to close.
So if you for example want to close issue number 400 (look at the URL => http://tickish.com/issues/400) then your commit message need to look like this.
=> Fixed the unsolvable bug #400
If you leave out the issue number, the commit will be ignored by the Tickish API, like this
=> Fixed the unsolvable bug

When the commit is pushed to Github, the specified issue will be commented and closed using the commit message as the comment and your name as the creator.
The work flow is identical to the Github issue tracker.
